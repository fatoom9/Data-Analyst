# TMDb Movie Data Analysis Project

This project is part of the Udacity Data Analysis Scholarship program. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the TMDb movie dataset, uncovering insights about movie trends, revenue, and other relevant factors. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to provide a comprehensive view of the dataset.

## Project Overview

The TMDb movie dataset contains information on movies, including release dates, genres, revenue, and popularity scores. This analysis seeks to answer questions such as:

- What genres are most popular over time?
- Which movies generated the highest revenue?
- How do different factors (like budget and runtime) correlate with revenue?

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from TMDb and was provided in a cleaned format by Udacity. It includes over 10,000 entries with features such as:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each movie
- `title`: Title of the movie
- `release_date`: Date of release
- `genres`: Movie genres
- `budget`: Budget of the movie in USD
- `revenue`: Revenue generated by the movie in USD
- `popularity`: Popularity score
- And more...

## Project Structure

- **TMDb_Movie_Analysis.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- **images/**: Contains any saved images from visualizations used in the notebook.
- **data/**: The cleaned dataset used in this project (optional if available).

## Libraries Used

This project was developed using Python and the following libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization
- `datetime`: For date handling

## Key Insights

Through this analysis, we discovered:

- **Popular genres**: Certain genres have consistently remained popular over time, while others fluctuate.
- **Revenue influencers**: High-budget movies tend to generate higher revenue, but other factors like genre and release timing also play a role.
- **Top-performing movies**: The analysis identifies the movies with the highest revenue, highlighting patterns among these successful films.
